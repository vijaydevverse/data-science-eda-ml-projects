## Overview

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Data Science projects completed as part of academic learning and practical exploration. Each project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

These projects demonstrate practical knowledge of data handling, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python.
